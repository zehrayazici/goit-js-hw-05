# goit-js-hw-05

This project was developed to reinforce practical JavaScript skills by implementing interactive functionality and dynamic behavior within a static HTML context, as part of the GoIT Fullstack Developer curriculum.

Aligned with core frontend development principles:

- JavaScript is extensively used to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and implement interactive logic based on user actions.
- Script files are organized within a dedicated `js/` directory to encourage modular structure and separation of concerns.
- Standard coding conventions are applied to improve readability and maintainability, including descriptive naming of functions and consistent formatting.
- The project focuses on vanilla JavaScript techniques without reliance on external libraries, promoting a deeper understanding of core language features.
- The HTML structure supports the dynamic behaviors implemented through JavaScript while maintaining semantic correctness.

This repository represents the fifth assignment in the GoIT JavaScript module and demonstrates practical application of scripting, DOM interaction, and event‑driven behavior in a client‑side environment.
